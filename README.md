# project

Program that encrypts or decryptes messages via the substitution method.

With a rearranged alphabet, you can take any message and change the location of the letter based on the rearranged alphabet key.

You may either use your own (in that cas it must not have any non-alphabetical characters or repeated characters) or ask the computer to generate one for you.
